# ðŸš€ Hey coder!

This is my coding space that contains all my projects and interests. I am a software engineering student passionate about coding, UI/UX design and software architecture. I have also published an article based on my research on microservices architecture testing.

I've worked with many programming languages, frameworks, and tools to developed applications!
